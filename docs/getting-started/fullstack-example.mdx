This example will walk through putting together a full stack app on KintoHub from the ground up and will take about 15 minutes.
If you are interested in a quick single service, check out our list of [examples](https://docs.kintohub.com/examples/nodejs/nodejs-example).

This example will deploy a **Todo List App** using `React`, `Hasura`, and `Postgres` which are available within KintoHub's free tier.

## Create a KintoHub Account

If you have not created a KintoHub account yet, to create one please click [here](https://app.kintohub.com).

## Deploy a Postgres Server

To store your data, you will need a Postgres database.
KintoHub provides a dedicated Postgres server with 1 GB of storage.

## Optimize Cost

**Congratulations! You have finished the full stack tutorial.**

If you are on a paid account and have already used your monthly free credits, the total cost of this environment can be optimized to a max cost of **$4.34** USD per month.
To do this, update your services with the following:

- Lower the [memory](../features/features-advanced.md#memory) of **todo-hasura** from `256` to `128` MB of memory
- Lower the [memory](../features/features-advanced.md#memory) of **postgres** from `256` to `128` MB of memory
- Lower the [memory](../features/features-advanced.md#memory) of **todo-react** from `256` to `32` MB of memory
